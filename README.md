### Old English: *4th -12th centuries*
In the 5th and 6th centuries, invaders, who were composed of the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes, set up the foundations for **Old English** with their **Anglo-Saxon dialects**. After the 6th century, many German "p" sounds changed to "pf", though Old English words kept their "p" sound. During this time, other influences were also being introuced to the growing English language, such as Swedish influences. In the years since, Swedish "sk" sounds have changed to "sh" sounds. In fact, many modern words with "sk" sounds actually come from Old Norse influences. Old Norse was introduced to English in the 8th - 11th centuries, during the Viking invasions of Englamd. Perhaphs one of the more influential invasions of England, at least in terms of language development, was the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Modern day English shares many similar words with Latin-derived languages, such as French, which was the primary language of the Normans
